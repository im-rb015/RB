1.Create rest api with CRUD operations.
Create product.json file with following structure 
{
    "products": [
      { "id": 101, "name": "Mobile", "make": "Apple "  , "qty": 100, "price": 11999.99  },
      { "id": 102, "name": "Laptop", " make ": "HP", "qty": 200, "price": 89999.99   },
    { "id": 103, "name": "Tab", " make ": "Samsung", "qty": 150, "price": 29999.99   }
    ]
  }
  
Use json server to load product.json file to load products data.
Write Node js rest application with following endpoints(url)
Post   -  /product       -add new  product
Get    -/products     - get all products
Get   -/product/:id   - get one prodcuct details for given id
Put  -/product/:id    -update product details  to change qty, price etc
Delete -/product/:id to delate given product

Use async and await , axios ,express middleware to connect to json file through http methods. Test all above urls in postman.
